# CS207 - Final Project
# Arduino Based weather conscious tank that turns on Head LED light whenever it's too dark using a photoresistor sensor. When it's too hot, the tank turns on a fan, red LEDs start to blink and triggers an alarm by playing an alarm like sound on the speaker. Whenever it reaches a colder temperature, the alarm shuts off.
